Complex, sure.  At times a bit obtuse, without a doubt.  But to be unveiled as nothing more than a set of pre-coded CSS classes was a bit underwhelming.  Not to say it isn't incredibly useful!  I plan on rewriting a few older projects of mine with Bootstrap in mind, since mobile accessibility has always been a sticking point of mine.  It's also clear that Bootstrap was designed with Flexbox at the forefront of its design philosophy.  With so many interweaving classes at risk of conflict with one another, Flexbox seems to provide the ideal way to avoid unnecessary complications in your design.
