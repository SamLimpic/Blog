It gave all of us a good opportunity to not only get to know our cohort a bit better, but also to assess our own skills relative to our peers.  It is helpful, I think, to have a realistic understanding if how your skills match up with others in your class, if only as a metric for areas that you require improvement upon.  The nice thing about working on this challenge in pairs is a direct line to somebody who may be more knowledgable in areas you feel you are deficient.  It also gives you a good idea of how forking GitHub repositories can be practically implemented in class, and allows you to familiarize yourself with an aspect of GitHub that will no doubt prove very useful in future!")]),e._v(" "),t("h2",{attrs:{id:"daily-challenges"}},[t("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#daily-challenges"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Daily Challenges")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("Afternoon: https://github.com/SamLimpic/partner-clone-challenge")]),e._v(" "),t("h3",{attrs:{id:"read-building-blocks-of-web-development-wire-framing-a-comprehensive-guide"}},[t("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#read-building-blocks-of-web-development-wire-framing-a-comprehensive-guide"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Read Building Blocks Of Web Development > "),t("em",[e._v("Wire-framing: A Comprehensive Guide")])]),e._v(" "),t("ol",[t("li",[t("p",[e._v("What is the purpose of wire-framing?\nWire framing allows you to build a quick framework of a webpage without worrying about specific design mechanics in HTML or CSS.

The layouts are more true-to-form, but they lack distracting page elements like images or typography.\nHigh-Fidelity wire frames are basically unhosted web sites.  The layout should mimick exactly what you are looking to reproduce in HTML and CSS, and the page should feature working links to other mock pages.

However, I personally would find it hard to justify the amount of effort put into drawing up a High-Fidelity wire frame.
