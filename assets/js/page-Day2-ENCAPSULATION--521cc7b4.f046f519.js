Don't get me wrong, I get the principle of the whole thing: gas burns, goes boom, makes engine go vroom.  Wheels turn, and brakes function, hydrolically.  Transmission... works.  I get it more or less.\nUnfortunately, it's probably gonna take a little more time to fully grasp all the minute details that go into what makes our MVCS template work the same way as base Javascript.\nI'm definitely getting there, but for the moment it feels like a 2 steps forward and 1 step back situation.  Code that I could confidently write in an hour last week took me closer to 3 to make work the same way today.\nStill, I can easily see the usefulness of building this code in such a way: every time it threw an error (many times) it directed me to the exact point in my framework where the code ceased to function properly, which provided a roadmap to solve the problem!")]),e._v(" "),t("h2",{attrs:{id:"daily-challenges"}},[t("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#daily-challenges"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Daily Challenges")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("Morning:")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("Afternoon: https://github.com/SamLimpic/vending-machine")]),e._v(" "),t("h3",{attrs:{id:"read-advancing-with-js-encapsulation-in-javascript"}},[t("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#read-advancing-with-js-encapsulation-in-javascript"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Read "),t("em",[e._v("Advancing with JS > Encapsulation in JavaScript")])]),e._v(" "),t("ol",[t("li",[t("p",[e._v('What is the purpose of "encapsulation?"\nSequester your code into compartmentalized sections designed to accomplish a single objective.
